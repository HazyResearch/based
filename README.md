Based is an efficient architecture inspired by recovering attention-like capabilities (i.e., *recall*). We do so by combining 2 simple ideas:
1. Short sliding window attention (e.g., window size 64), to model fine-grained local dependencies
2. "Dense" and global *linear* attention, to model long-range dependencies

In this way, we aim to capture the same dependencies as Transformers in a 100% subquadratic model, with *exact* softmax attention locally and a softmax-approximating linear attention for all other tokens. 

We find this helps close many of the performance gaps between Transformers and recent subquadratic alternatives (matching perplexity is not all you need? [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04927), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01032), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04248)]).

In this repo, please find code to (1) train new models and (2) evaluate existing checkpoints on downstream tasks.

## Installation

**Note.** The code in this repository is tested on `python=3.8.18` and `torch=2.1.2`. We recommend using these versions in a clean environment. 

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:HazyResearch/based.git
cd based

# install torch
pip install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 torchaudio==2.1.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 # due to observed causal-conv1d dependency

# install based package
pip install -e .
```

## Pretrained Checkpoints

We are releasing the following checkpoints for research, trained at the 360M and 1.3Bn parameter scales. Each checkpoint is trained on the same 10Bn tokens of the Pile corpus, using the same data order. The checkpoints are trained using the same code and infrastructure.  

Use the code below to load any of the checkpoints:
```python  
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from based.models.gpt import GPTLMHeadModel

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPTLMHeadModel.from_pretrained_hf("hazyresearch/based-360m").to("cuda")
```

**Warning.** We are releasing these models for the purpose of efficient architecture research. Because they have not been instruction fine-tuned or audited, they are not intended for use in any downstream applications. 

You can try running a simple text generation with the following. 
```python
input = tokenizer.encode("If I take one more step, it will be", return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
output = model.generate(input, max_length=20)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0]))
```

**Note.** For the checkpoints from other models, you will need to install other dependencies. 

To use the Transformer and Mamba checkpoints, you will need the following installations:
```bash
# transformer
pip install flash_attn

# mamba
pip install mamba-ssm
```


## Train
In order to train a new model with our code, you'll need to do a bit more setup: 
```python
# install train extra dependencies
pip install -e .[train]

# install apex
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex
cd apex
pip install -v --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation --config-settings "--build-option=--cpp_ext" --config-settings "--build-option=--cuda_ext" ./
cd ..
```

To train a new model, construct a config.yaml file at ```train/configs/experiment/```. We are including the configs used to produce the pretrained checkpoints for the paper (released on HF below) at ```train/configs/experiment/reference/```.

You can launch a training job using the following command from the ```train/``` directory, where you can modify the config name and number of GPUs (```trainer.devices```):
```
cd train/
python run.py experiment=reference/based-1.3b trainer.devices=8
```

In our paper, we evaluated on the Pile corpus, which is no longer available online, so the ```train/configs/experiment/reference/``` configs are unfortunately not directly runnable. For your use, we are including example configs that would train on the [SlimPajama-627B dataset from Cerebras](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cerebras/SlimPajama-627B). You can launch using the following script:
```
cd train/
python run.py experiment=example/based-360m trainer.devices=8
```

 You can adapt the training dataset by adding a new dataset config file under ```train/configs/datamodule/```. Follow the examples in ```wikitext103.yaml```. Once you've constructed the yaml file for your new dataset, go to the experiment config (e.g. ```train/configs/experiment/example/based-360m.yaml```) and update the name of the datamodule under ```override datamodule``` to the filename of your new dataset yaml file. 

 Note that this training code is from: https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/tree/main/training


## Evaluate
In our paper, we evaluate pretrained language models on a standard suite of benchmarks from the LM Evaluation Harness, as well as a new suite of three *recall-intensive* tasks:

- **SWDE** (Info. extraction). A popular information extraction benchmark for semi-structured data. SWDE includes raw HTML docuemtns from 8 Movie and 5 University websites (e.g.IMDB, US News) and annotations for 8-274 attributes per website (e.g., Movie runtime). **HuggingFace: [hazyresearch/based-swde](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hazyresearch/based-swde)**
- **FDA** (Info. extraction). A popular information extraction benchmark for unstructured data. The FDA setting contains 16 gold attributes and 100 PDF documents, which are up to 20 pages long, randomly sampled from FDA 510(k). **HuggingFace: [hazyresearch/based-fda](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hazyresearch/based-swde)**
- **SQUAD-Completion** (Document-QA). We find that original SQUAD dataset is challenging for our models without instruction fine-tuning. So we introduce a modified version of SQUAD where questions are reworded as next-token prediction tasks. For example, "What is the capital of France?" becomes "The capital of France is". **HuggingFace: [hazyresearch/based-squad](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hazyresearch/based-swde)**

Under `evaluate`, we have a clone of EleutherAI's [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) that includes these new tasks and provides scripts for running all the evaluations from the paper. The following instructions can be used to reproduce our results on the [LM-Eval harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) using the pretrained checkpoints.


### Setup.
TODO: Update this. 
```bash
cd evaluate 

# init the submodule and install
git submodule init
git submodule update
pip install -e . 
```


### Evaluations.

```
cd evals/
bash run_harness.sh
```


## Experiments on Synthetic Data
In our paper, we demonstrate the recall-throughput tradeoff using a synthetic associative recall task (see Figure 2, below, and Figure 3 in the paper). 
<div align="center" >
    <img src="assets/tradeoff.png" height=200 alt="" style="margin-bottom:px"/> 
</div>

The code for reproducing these figures is provided in a separate repository: [HazyResearch/zoology](https://github.com/HazyResearch/zoology). Follow the setup instruction in the Zoology README. The instructions for reproducing the are provided in [zoology/experiments](https://github.com/HazyResearch/zoology/tree/main/zoology/experiments). For example, you can create the figure above using. 

```
python -m zoology.launch zoology/experiments/arxiv24_based_figure2/configs.py -p
```


## Benchmarking and Efficiency

We include the kernels evaluated in the Based paper under ```based/benchmarking/```. We provide additional details on the CUDA releases in the README in this folder. Stay tuned!
